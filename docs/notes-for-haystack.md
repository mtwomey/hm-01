# Notes for integration into main Haystack codebase

The only files that need to be contributed to Haystack are:

- mongo_atlas.py
- mongo_converters.py
- mongo_filters.py

These files are located in `src/mongo_haystack/document_stores`

A markdown "readme" file following the format of the docs located here: https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack-integrations/tree/main/integrations is located in this  same directory: `mongo-atlas-document-store.md`
